# OpenCV-Recognition-of-Block-Coloured-Objects-V2

Abstract

This program is an expansion on the first version whereby morphological operations are performed for more accurate recognition. Also the object being recognised will have an outline around it on the main video feed showing the user the object has been detected.

Procedure

Assuming the 'Recognition of Objects Colour' and 'Recognition of Block Coloured Objects V1' have been trialed then using this program should be straight forward.

- Set up parameters for colour of objects. Change the string values to the colours being used if need be as well as the filter values.

- Run program. User to specify what colour the object to be detcted is.

- If a correct option has been chosen the object should have a gold outline around it in the camera feed window.
